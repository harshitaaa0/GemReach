# üåü GemReach  

AI-powered assistant to generate and save personalized cold emails using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**.  

---

## üìå About  
**GemReach** is a cold email generator for product/service promotion powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM**, **Agents framework**, **asyncio**, and **pydantic**.  

It allows users to input details such as **tone, audience, LinkedIn profile url & product details**. The tool then generates **multiple personalized cold email drafts** with different tones and styles. Once reviewed, the selected draft is saved as a text file, ready to be sent.  

üí° **Use Case Example:**  
A startup launches a new **AI-powered SaaS tool** and wants to reach potential clients efficiently. Instead of manually drafting dozens of emails, the business development executive uses GemReach. With just a few inputs, the system creates professional cold emails tailored to the audience‚Äîhelping save time, maintain consistency, and increase outreach success.
